    /*
    Tell me 5 exception that you get/What type of exceptions do you get in selenium?
    Null pointer, no such element, time out, slate element reference, web driver

    What is your solution?
    Read the error message and learn what is the error and where it is.
    In general, error happens because of the timing issue, wrong locator, or iframe/windows/alerts
    Each error has specific solutions but in general, I debug my code, and do some research then execute
    the code one more time after the fix.

    What type of waits do you use?
    I use implicit or explicit wait

    Which wait do you prefer?
    Explicit wait works better in some cases. When I use explicit wait, and still see timeout exception, then
    there can be other issues such as incorrect locators.

    Why do you prefer that wait?
    I already have implicit wait in my Driver class, but I prefer explicit wait when I need to use an expected
    condition such as element is not visible.

    How do you resolve synchronization issue?
    I use implicit or explicit wait. In my driver class, I already have implicit wait, that handles most of the wait
    issues, but when it is not enough than I use explicit wait.
