    Q19- What are the advantages of using Selenium WebDriver?
    Selenium is open source.
    It has huge support from the community, means if you stuck at some point while working on it, you can get answers
    for your problem from internet easily as, a lot people are working on it.
    It supports multiple languages like., Java, Python, C#, Ruby, Perl etc.
    It supports almost every browser., like firefox, chrome, edge, safari etc.
    Regular updates.
    Easy to maintain the code.
    It reduces the time and effort with respect to Manual testing.

    Q20- What are the dis-advantages of using Selenium WebDriver?
    We can only test web applications with Selenium and cannot automate Mobile or Desktop applications.
    No reporting mechanism available. We have to integrate third party tools like TestNG or Allure for reporting.
    No in-built logging mechanism.
    One should have basic knowledge of HTML to locate elements.
    One should have proper knowledge of any programming language.

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Q21- What is Selenese?
    Selenese is the set of Selenium commands. We can divide Selenese or Selenium commands into three categories:
    Actions - They are used to perform interactions with web elements.
    Accessors - They are used to store values in variables.
    Assertions - They are used to validation.

    Q22- Can you name some of the Selenium exceptions?
    TimeoutException
    WebDriverException
    NoAlertPresentException
    NoSuchWindowException
    NoSuchElementException

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Q23- What is Desired Capabilities in Selenium WebDriver?
    DesiredCapabilities is a class in Selenium which is used to set/get browser properties or you can also say it is used for
    setting the configuration of the browser before running selenium tests on it. You can set accept ssl errors, enable/disable
    alerts, set browser name or version etc.


    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Q24- Can we perform Database testing with Selenium?
    Selenium itself doesn't support database testing, but we can perform database testing using any language's database library.
    Like if we are using Selenium with Java then we can use Java's JDBC library to write out database tests. JDBC allows us to
    execute the SQL queries and we can verify the SQL query results.

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q25- Can we handle window dialogs using Selenium?
    No window cannot interact with window dialogs on its own. That's why upload file dialogs or download file dialogs can't
    be handled with Selenium. But we can handle them in the Selenium script by using third party tools or some other Java
    libraries. Like., we can make use of the Robot Class library of Java to handle those dialogs or we can use third party
    tool AutoIT to handle such window dialogs. We can integrate AutoIT code inside the Selenium WebDriver code.

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Q26 - What different types of testing can be done using Selenium?
    Selenium is basically used for Functional testing and it doesn't support non-functional testing like Performance testing,
    UI testing, Usability testing, Security testing. And in functional testing it is mostly used for automating

    Regression Testing
    Smoke Testing
    Sanity Testing
